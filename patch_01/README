This is necessary because "BCLR" and "BSET" alter the Carry bit, so
these instructions can't be in fast interrupts.  This patch moves them
into a long interrupt, which causes auto-storage of the status
register.

It's important to create the new routines before activating them.

This patch generates an ugly "rough" version... only the stuff before
0x100 matters.
