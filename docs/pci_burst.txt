 To do
-------

- Enforce maximum packet size!  Should be writable by application and
  correspond to buffer granularity so that data is safe.

- Use memory leases for multi-frame bursts

 PCI Bursts
------------

A PCI burst is when a bus master (e.g. a PCI card) obtains access to
the PCI bus and writes some data to some target.  In PC language this
is sometimes called DMA.  Since our DSP also has internal DMA, we
won't call a PCI burst DMA.  We'll call it a PCI burst.

The details of how to perform a PCI burst are given in AN1780.
Basically, you write some words into the HTXR register (the HI32's PCI
transmit fifo) and then write some control words to PCI burst
registers.  Once this is done, the DSP's PCI stuff will try to get
access to the bus and initiate a burst transfer of the data in the
fifo.

 +---------------------------------------------+        +---------+

The maximum size of a PCI burst is 256 bytes; the typical unit of
measurement is a dword or 32 bit word.

Bursts can fail; this is part of the bus arbitration process.  There
is a well-defined (but a bit difficult to track down) procedure for
recovering from such failures.


 DMA + PCI Burst
-----------------

DMA can be used to transfer the burst data from some location in DSP
memory to the HTXR (PCI module transmit fifo).  This is separate from
the PCI burst, so if the PCI burst fails it is NOT necessary to
restart the DMA.  If you do restart the DMA, make sure you have
cleared the HTXR fifo first!


 Procedure for DMA + PCI Burst  --  see AN1780
-----------------------------------------------

1. Initiate DMA from source buffer to the HTXR.

2. Initiate a PCI burst to some destination address in PC main memory.

3. Wait for the burst to complete.  If it was successful, exit.  If not:

4. Check if the error was of type "restart" or "resume".  If restart,
   simply reinitiate the burst with the same setting; i.e. goto 2.
   If resume:

5. Part of the burst succeeded.  Update the PC main memory destination
   address and the burst length to reflect this, and goto 2.


 Current code
--------------

The original SDSU code does not follow this prescription.  On error,
it both restarts the DMA and reinitiates the PCI burst.  It does not
distinguish between "resume" and "restart" errors.


 Code modifications
--------------------

Existing code has separate blocks for transferring chunks of 1024, 64,
and 2 bytes.  This has been replaced with generic code that will
transfer any size (with the caveat that each transfer is rounded up to
a multiple of 32 bytes! -- so it's ok to break a frame of size 5424
into smaller blocks, as long as every block except the last is a
multiple of 32... so you can wait for the fibre fifo to be 1/2 full
(1024 bytes) and send that off for PCI, then get another block, and
then transfer the last 304 bytes).  Your destination buffers should be
aligned on 32 byte boundaries and should not cross a $10000 boundary.
(All of these restrictions could be relaxed fairly easily; but they
haven't yet.)

The current model in version 1.05A is:

 1. Buffer the entire packet into Y memory, including that any data
    above 4kB goes into off-chip SRAM.

 2. Load the PCI dest'n address and transfer size and source address
    into special variables

 3. Call the BLOCK_TRANSFER function to do the whole packet.

Bear in mind that PCI bursts are limited to 256 bytes, so the packet
will be naturally broken up into things that big or smaller.


 Latency timers, 2.6 kernels, and PCI data rates
--------------------------------------------------

The theoretical peak data rate for the PCI bus is 133 MB/s.  This is
obtained by multiplying the bus clock rate (33 MHz) times the bus
width (32 bits).  A single(four) card packet of size 1488(5424) should
then, ideally, transfer in 11(41) us.

In order to give other devices access (or the option to access) the
bus, the bus controller can interrupt a bus master during a burst.
The frequency with which this may happen is determined by a number
called the "latency timer", which is assigned to each device by the
operating system.  Numbers like 32 are not uncommon; that indicates
that if the device hogs the bus for longer than 32 clock cycles, the
controller is allowed to interrupt it.

On the DSP, these interruptions are seen as TO errors.

In kernel 2.4, bus errors seem caused only by contention.  On 2.6, we
see TO errors quite regularly if we try to DMA blocks larger than or
equal to 32 dwords.  Inspection of the PCI configuration block for the
DSP card shows that the latency timer (byte 0xd in
/proc/bus/pci/06/01.0, see LDD...) is set to 32.

The question arises as to whether there is still a speed advantage to
transferring larger blocks; the penalty to resume a transfer may be
smaller than the overhead of using smaller blocks.  Here are some
timings, for different block sizes.  Note that ~100 us of these times
are likely due to the packet buffering and not related to the DMA
transfer.

 block (bytes)   bus errors    time (us)
------------------------------------------
 0x100              18           172
 0x080              12           170
 0x040               0           168
 0x020               0           204
 0x010               0           261

From which we conclude that larger blocks are better, regardless of
bus errors, and that ideally we set the block size to be one half of
the latency timer value to avoid bus errors.


 Assembler notes
-----------------

Details are in the DSP-FM.  A few caveats:

Words are 24 bits.  Most registers are 24 bits, and memory is 24 bits
wide.  Little 24 bit registers are X0,X1,Y0,Y1.

The big, 56 bit accumulator registers are called A and B, and are
broken up into, e.g.

	A2:A1:A0

with A1 and A0 each 24 bits, and A2 the most significant eight bits.

Many literal operations act only on A or B.  When this is the case,
they take effect in bits 47:24 of the chosen accumulator, i.e. A1, and
are zero extended to the rest of A.

This includes: OR, AND, ADD, SUB, CMP, MOVE.  e.g.

     MOVE      X:VARIABLE,A

will put the 24 bits of data at location VARIABLE in X memory into A1,
zeroing (or maybe sign-extending) A2 and A0.

     AND       #$00ffff,A

will do "AND #$00ffff,A1" and "AND 0,A0" and probably something else.
Watch for it.

A notable exception is the INC instruction, which acts on the entirety
of A.  I.e., if A=0, INC A will make A0=1 and A1=0.

Flags and comparisons:

As usual, the CMP A,B instruction performs a subtraction B-A and sets
the flags.  The relevant flags on the DSP are Z, N, and V.  Z
indicates a zero result, N indicates a negative result, and V
indicates an overflow (result exceeds 48 bits).  The relevant "carry"
quantity is N ^ V; consider 0x80 - 0x01 = -129 = 0x7f with V=1; since
N=0 we get N^V = 1 indicating that -128 < -1, as expected.

Anyway, the moral of the story is that CMP A,B asks "how does B relate
to A?" and gives answers like "B is less than A".

   CMP A,B
   JLE skip_factory
   ** handle the case that B > A **
skip_factory


Literals:

MOVES ARE MESSED UP!  e.g. MOVE #$0100,A puts $100 in A but MOVE
#$0040,A puts $400000 in A!!  You must force short (8bit) or long
(24bit) literals like this: MOVE #>$40,B will treat $40 as 24 bits and
store it in B1.

Wide accumulators:

MOVE A,B doesn't copy all 48 bits all the time.  A better approach is
  ASL #0,A,B
